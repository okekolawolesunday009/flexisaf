# ES6 Features Highlighted in the App

This project demonstrates the use of modern ES6+ JavaScript features in building a dynamic and interactive web application. The application focuses on task management and statistical insights, leveraging the following features:

## 🚀 Key ES6 Features

### 1. **Variable Scoping**
- **`let`** and **`const`**: Used throughout the application to ensure proper variable scoping and immutability where applicable.

### 2. **Arrow Functions**
- Simplified syntax for callbacks, improving readability in methods like:
  - **`filter`**
  - **`map`**
  - **`reduce`**

### 3. **Array Methods**
- **`filter`**: Used to filter tasks based on criteria.
- **`reduce`**: Utilized to calculate summary statistics for tasks.
- **`forEach`**: Employed to iterate and display tasks efficiently.

### 4. **Objects**
- Tasks and their metadata are stored and managed using JavaScript objects for clean data handling.

### 5. **Template Literals**
- Enhanced string formatting for displaying task details and summary statistics dynamically.
